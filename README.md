# Temperamental

A web toy allowing you to hear and play with different kinds of tunings.

Inspired by John Carlos Baez's series of blog posts about different temperament
systems - see https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2023/10/13/perfect-fifths-in-equal-tempered-scales/

It's all very well but I need to _hear_ what is going on to have a hope of
understanding.
